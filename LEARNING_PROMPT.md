# Infrastructure as Code Learning Journey

Act as an experienced DevOps engineer and guide me through implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC) on AWS. This project is based on the roadmap.sh IaC project but enhanced for AWS with additional features.

## Learning Objectives
Help me understand and implement:
1. Infrastructure as Code principles
2. AWS infrastructure management
3. Configuration management with Ansible
4. Web server security best practices
5. SSL certificate automation
6. Domain management

## Project Requirements

### Infrastructure Components
1. Two EC2 instances:
   - Control Node: Amazon Linux 2023
   - Target Node: Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
2. Security Groups with proper inbound/outbound rules
3. Domain configuration with SSL

### Tools and Technologies
1. AWS Account and CLI
2. Terraform for infrastructure
3. Ansible for configuration
4. Nginx web server
5. Let's Encrypt SSL

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: AWS Setup and Basics

2. Help me understand IAM and create a user with proper permissions
3. Explain AWS regions and availability zones
4. Show me how to set up AWS credentials securely
5. Guide me through EC2 instance types and AMIs

### Phase 2: Infrastructure with Terraform
1. Help me understand Terraform basics
2. Guide me through creating:
   - providers.tf for AWS configuration

   - Apply infrastructure
   - Manage state

### Phase 3: Configuration Management with Ansible
1. Explain Ansible concepts:
   - Inventory
   - Playbooks
   - Roles
   - Tasks
   - Templates
2. Guide me through creating roles:
   - Base role for system configuration
   - Nginx role for web server
   - App role for deployment
   - SSH role for security
3. Show me how to:
   - Structure Ansible projects
   - Write idempotent tasks
   - Use variables and templates
   - Handle different OS families

### Phase 4: Web Server and Security
1. Help me understand:
   - Nginx configuration
   - SSL/TLS concepts
   - Security headers
   - SSH hardening
2. Guide me through:
   - Setting up Nginx properly
   - Obtaining SSL certificates
   - Configuring security headers
   - Implementing SSH best practices

### Phase 5: Integration and Testing
1. Show me how to:
   - Connect all components
   - Test the infrastructure
   - Verify security
   - Monitor the system

## Practical Exercises

For each phase, guide me through hands-on exercises:

1. **AWS Setup Exercise**
   - Create IAM user
   - Set up AWS CLI
   - Launch test EC2 instance

2. **Terraform Exercise**

   - Create security group
   - Launch EC2 instances
   - Output important values

3. **Ansible Exercise**
   - Create inventory
   - Write basic playbook
   - Develop roles
   - Test configuration

4. **Security Exercise**
   - Configure SSL
   - Set up security headers
   - Implement SSH hardening
   - Test security measures
